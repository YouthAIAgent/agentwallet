## Problem Statement

AI agents are becoming autonomous economic actors — they negotiate, trade, pay for services, and manage funds. But today, they operate with human wallets that were never designed for programmatic control.

**The result:**

- **No spending limits** — A compromised agent can drain everything
- **No escrow** — No trustless way for agents to pay each other for tasks
- **No audit trail** — Zero visibility into what agents are spending and why
- **No compliance** — No framework for EU AI Act, SOX, or regulatory reporting
- **Key management nightmare** — Private keys floating in `.env` files, one leak = game over

Every major AI lab (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) is shipping agent frameworks. None of them have solved the wallet problem. Agents need financial infrastructure built for agents — not adapted human wallets.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture: 10-Layer Agentic Commerce Stack

AgentWallet is a **full-stack wallet-as-a-service protocol** built on Solana, designed ground-up for autonomous AI agents.

```
Foundation Model (Claude/GPT/Gemini)
        ↕
MCP Layer (33 AI-native tools)
        ↕
Agent Identity & Registry
        ↕
AgentWallet Protocol (orchestration)
        ↕
x402 HTTP-Native Payments
        ↕
Universal Balance Aggregation
        ↕
Account Abstraction (PDAs)
        ↕
Stablecoin Settlement
        ↕
Wallet Engine (encrypted keys)
        ↕
Solana Blockchain (on-chain PDAs)
```

### On-Chain Program (Anchor/Rust)

Three PDAs power the core logic:

| PDA | Seeds | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AgentWallet` | `["agent_wallet", org, agent_id]` | Per-tx + daily spending limits, spend tracking |
| `EscrowAccount` | `["escrow", escrow_id]` | Trustless fund locking with funder/recipient/arbiter |
| `PlatformConfig` | `["platform_config"]` | Fee wallet address, fee basis points |

**7 Anchor Instructions:**
- `create_agent_wallet` — Init wallet PDA with spending limits
- `transfer_with_limit` — Enforce limits → deduct fee → transfer SOL
- `update_limits` — Authority updates per-tx/daily limits
- `create_escrow` — Fund escrow PDA with SOL
- `release_escrow` — Release to recipient (funder/arbiter authorized)
- `refund_escrow` — Refund to funder (arbiter/expiry authorized)
- `initialize_platform_config` — Bootstrap fee configuration

**Security hardening (8 verified fixes):**
- Mandatory ENCRYPTION_KEY (no silent ephemeral key generation)
- Escrow PDA closing on release/refund (reclaim rent-exempt SOL)
- Zero-amount escrow validation
- Rate limiting on auth routes
- API key hashing upgraded to HMAC-SHA256
- JWT secret minimum 32-char validation
- Fee behavior fully documented
- Program ID placeholder warning for mainnet

### Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis)

- **12 API routers** covering agents, wallets, transactions, escrow, policies, analytics, compliance, webhooks, billing, auth
- **16 SQLAlchemy models** — 14-table schema with full relational integrity
- **7 background workers** — tx processing, webhook delivery, analytics rollup, escrow expiry, usage metering
- **Permission Engine** — JSON policy rules evaluated on every transaction:
  - `spending_limit_lamports` (per-tx cap)
  - `daily_limit_lamports` (rolling 24h)
  - `destination_whitelist/blacklist`
  - `token_whitelist`
  - `time_window` restrictions
  - `require_approval_above` (human-in-the-loop for large amounts)
- **Dual auth** — JWT tokens + API keys (`aw_live_` / `aw_test_`)
- **Immutable audit log** for every state change
- **Anomaly detection** — velocity spikes, unusual amounts, high failure rates

### Python SDK (PyPI Published)

```bash
pip install aw-protocol-sdk==0.1.0
```

Stripe-like async client with typed responses:

```python
from agentwallet import AgentWallet

async with AgentWallet(api_key="aw_live_...") as aw:
    agent = await aw.agents.create(name="trading-bot", capabilities=["trading"])
    wallet = (await aw.wallets.list(agent_id=agent.id)).data[0]
    
    # Policy-enforced, fee-deducted, audit-logged transfer
    tx = await aw.transactions.transfer_sol(
        from_wallet=wallet.id,
        to_address="Recipient...",
        amount_sol=0.5
    )
    
    # Trustless escrow for agent-to-agent tasks
    escrow = await aw.escrow.create(
        funder_wallet=wallet.id,
        recipient_address="WorkerAgent...",
        amount_sol=1.0,
        expires_in_hours=24
    )
    await aw.escrow.release(escrow.id)
```

### MCP Integration (33 AI-Native Tools)

Any MCP-compatible AI (Claude, GPT, Cursor) can create wallets, transfer SOL, manage escrow as native tools. Zero integration friction — agents interact with AgentWallet the same way they interact with everything else.

### Dashboard (React + TypeScript)

9-page dark-themed dashboard: Dashboard overview, Agents, Wallets, Transactions, Analytics (Recharts), Policies, Audit Log, Billing, Login.

### CLI (Rich Terminal)

Live terminal dashboard with real-time stats, agent management, wallet operations.

## What Makes AgentWallet Different

| Feature | Human Wallets | AgentWallet |
|---|---|---|
| Spending Limits | ❌ None | ✅ Per-tx + daily caps |
| Escrow | ❌ Manual | ✅ On-chain PDA, trustless |
| Audit Trail | ❌ None | ✅ Immutable, every state change |
| Policy Engine | ❌ None | ✅ 7 rule types, auto-enforced |
| Agent Identity | ❌ Share human wallet | ✅ Dedicated PDA per agent |
| Key Security | ❌ `.env` files | ✅ Encrypted at rest (Fernet/KMS) |
| MCP Integration | ❌ None | ✅ 33 native tools |
| Compliance | ❌ None | ✅ EU AI Act reporting |
| Multi-agent | ❌ Not designed for it | ✅ Built for fleets of agents |

---

## Target Audience

### Primary
- **AI Agent Developers** building autonomous agents that need to transact (trading bots, data procurement agents, service agents)
- **AI Startups** deploying fleets of agents that manage funds (customer service, autonomous trading, content creation)
- **MCP Tool Builders** who want financial capabilities as plug-and-play tools

### Secondary
- **DeFi Protocols** integrating agent-based trading and liquidity management
- **Enterprise AI Teams** needing compliant, auditable agent financial operations
- **DAOs** using agents for treasury management with programmatic controls

### Market Size
The AI agent market is projected to reach $65B by 2030. Every one of these agents will need a wallet. AgentWallet is the infrastructure layer that makes that possible.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Transaction Fees** — Basis point fee on every on-chain transaction (configurable per platform deployment)
2. **Tiered API Access:**
   - **Free Tier** — 100 agents, 10K tx/month, community support
   - **Pro Tier** ($49/mo) — 1,000 agents, 100K tx/month, priority support, advanced analytics
   - **Enterprise** (Custom) — Unlimited, SLA, dedicated infrastructure, compliance reports
3. **Self-Hosted License** — Open-source core (MIT), premium enterprise features

### Unit Economics
- Near-zero marginal cost per transaction (Solana fees: ~$0.00025)
- Revenue scales linearly with agent economy growth
- Platform fees compound as agent-to-agent commerce increases

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | AgentWallet Advantage |
|---|---|---|
| **Coinbase CDP** | General wallet SDK, not agent-specific | Agent-native from day one: PDAs, policies, escrow |
| **Crossmint** | NFT/wallet API | No spending limits, no escrow, no compliance |
| **Dynamic.xyz** | Embedded wallets for users | Built for humans, not autonomous agents |
| **Turnkey** | Key management infra | Low-level — no policy engine, no analytics |
| **Circle (CCTP)** | Cross-chain USDC | Payment rail only — no agent identity or control |

**Our moat:** Purpose-built for the agentic economy. Not a human wallet adapted for agents — an agent wallet from the ground up.
