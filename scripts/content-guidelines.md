# AgentWallet Content Guidelines — MANDATORY

## Core Identity
- We are BUILDING IN PUBLIC — an open-source protocol
- AgentWallet Protocol = Solana PDA wallets for AI agents
- $AGENTPRO = community token on bags.fm (NOT a fundraiser)

## TONE — Builder-First, Never Beggar
✅ DO:
- "We're building X" / "Just shipped Y" / "Here's what we're working on"
- Share progress, commits, architecture decisions
- Frame $AGENTPRO as "community can participate in what we're building"
- Builder updates: "pushed 3 commits today", "new MCP tool added"
- Technical deep dives that show real engineering
- "Open source. Check the code." energy
- Celebrate community growth organically

❌ DON'T:
- Never say "fund us" / "support us" / "help us build"
- Never beg for buys/investment
- Never "please RT" or "help us reach X"
- Never frame token as donation/charity
- Never use desperate/needy language
- No "we need your support" energy

## $AGENTPRO Framing
- "Community token for an open-source AI protocol"
- "100% royalties go back to development" (fact, not plea)
- "Real product. Real code. Real builders." 
- Let the product speak — show GitHub, show architecture, show commits
- If someone buys, cool. If not, we keep building anyway.

## Content Mix (per day):
- 60% — Builder updates, technical posts, architecture deep dives
- 20% — $AGENTPRO token stats/updates (organic, not shilly)
- 20% — Industry takes, hot takes, engagement posts

## Voice
- Senior builder shipping in public
- Confident, not arrogant
- Technical depth shows credibility
- "We shipped this" > "We're planning this"
- Community grows because product is good, not because we asked

## BANNED Words (always):
revolutionizing, leveraging, groundbreaking, exciting, game-changing,
fund us, support us, help us, donate, invest in us, back us
